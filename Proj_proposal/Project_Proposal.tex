        \underline{Project Proposal: Squidscript}    
    \end{center}

We are creating a programming language with emphasis on an intuitively designed syntax that is easy for beginner and experienced programmers alike to pick up and understand. For the scope of this project, we will be constructing an interpreter in Golang that will consist of three main components:

\begin{itemize}

\item Lexer (“tokenizer of the syntax”)
\item Parser (“checks if the tokens make a valid program”)
\item Evaluator (“Executes the parsed tokens”)

\end{itemize}

Our goal for this project is to construct a fully functional interpreter by hand, while still utilizing the garbage collector of the host language.

So far we are still in the syntax design phase of this project and have thus far created a rough-draft template of what Squidscript’s syntax will look like:
